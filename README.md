# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-2

This repository contains project work from a DSA 2 course taken at The Cooper Union.

"Programming-Assignment-1-Spellchecker" - this folder contains project work that involved creating a spellchecking program that utilizes a hash table. The hash table class had to be created for this project.

"Programming-Assignment-2-Heap" - this folder contains project work that involved creating a heap (priority queue) & testing it with a manipulator program.

"Programming-Assignment-3-Dijkstra" - this folder contains project work that involved implementing Dijkstra's algorithm using both the heap and hash table that were previously created for the first two assignments. Dijkstra's algorithm solves the single source, shortest path problem for positive edge weights.
